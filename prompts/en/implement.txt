Repository Context:
- Path: {repo_path}
- Branch: {branch_name}
- Base branch: {target_branch}
- Sample files: {repo_files}

Task List:
{todo_list}

Your job:
1. Analyze the repository structure
2. Implement ALL tasks from the checklist above
3. Generate a unified diff patch with your changes
4. Enclose the patch in triple backticks with 'diff' language marker

Requirements:
- Produce working, tested code
- Follow existing code style and patterns
- Include necessary imports and dependencies
- Add inline comments for complex logic
- Check if there is an appropriate .gitignore file; if not, create one based on the current technology stack. If it already exists, update it to match the technology stack and ensure it includes these automation files: patch_raw.txt, todo.md, plan.json, commit_msg.txt
