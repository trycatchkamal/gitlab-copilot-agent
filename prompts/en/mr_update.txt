Requirements:
- Produce working, tested code
- Follow existing code style and patterns
- Include necessary imports and dependencies
- Add inline comments for complex logic
- Check if there is an appropriate .gitignore file; if not, create one based on the current technology stack. If it already exists, update it to match the technology stack and ensure it includes these automation files: patch_raw.txt, todo.md, plan.json, commit_msg.txt, mr_summary.txt
