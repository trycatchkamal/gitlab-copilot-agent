You are GitHub Copilot CLI acting as a technical delivery lead.

Task: Analyze the following GitLab issue and generate a concrete engineering plan.

Issue Context:
- Title: {issue_title}
- IID: {issue_iid}
- Project: {project_path}
- URL: {issue_url}

Issue Description:
{issue_description}

CRITICAL: You must write your response directly to a file named 'plan.json' in the current directory.
Use the file writing capability to create this file with valid JSON containing exactly two keys:
1. "branch": A kebab-case branch name (e.g., issue-{issue_iid}-add-login-feature)
2. "todo_markdown": A Markdown checklist with actionable tasks using - [ ] format

Requirements for the plan:
- Break the issue into concrete, testable steps
- Reference specific files/components when applicable
- Include implementation, testing, and documentation tasks
- Keep tasks focused and atomic
- Use clear, imperative language

Example JSON structure to write to plan.json:
```
{
  "branch": "issue-{issue_iid}-implement-feature",
  "todo_markdown": "- [ ] Create auth module\\n- [ ] Add unit tests\\n- [ ] Update documentation"
}
```

Please write the plan.json file with the structured plan. You can briefly acknowledge the task, then create the file.
